Data scienceis aninterdisciplinaryacademic field[1]that usesstatistics,scientific computing,scientific methods, processing,scientific visualization,algorithmsand systems to extract or extrapolateknowledgefrom potentially noisy,structured, orunstructured data.[2]
Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3]Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]
Data science is "a concept to unifystatistics,data analysis,informatics, and their relatedmethods" to "understand and analyze actualphenomena" withdata.[5]It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context ofmathematics, statistics,computer science,information science, anddomain knowledge.[6]However, data science is different fromcomputer scienceand information science.Turing AwardwinnerJim Grayimagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical,theoretical,computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact ofinformation technology" and thedata deluge.[7][8]
Adata scientistis a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.[9]
Data science is aninterdisciplinaryfield[10]focused onextracting knowledgefrom typicallylargedata setsand applying the knowledge from that data to solve problems in other application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems,analyzingdata, and summarizing these findings. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics,data visualization,graphic design,communication, andbusiness.[11]
Vasant Dharwrites that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.[12]Andrew GelmanofColumbia Universityhas described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.[13]Stanford professorDavid Donohowrites that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.[14]
In 1962,John Tukeydescribed a field he called "data analysis", which resembles modern data science.[14]In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing,C. F. Jeff Wuused the term "data science" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics.[15]Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at theUniversity of Montpellier  IIacknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.[16][17]
The term "data science" has been traced back to 1974, whenPeter Naurproposed it as an alternative name to computer science.[6]In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic.[6]However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997C. F. Jeff Wuagain suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data.[18]In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.[17]
In 2012, technologistsThomas H. DavenportandDJ Patildeclared "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[19]a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like theNew York Times[20]and theBoston Globe.[21]A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that "the job is more in demand than ever with employers".[22]
The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed toWilliam S. Cleveland.[23]In 2014, theAmerican Statistical Association's Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.[24]
The professional title of "data scientist" has been attributed toDJ PatilandJeff Hammerbacherin 2008.[25]Though it was used by theNational Science Boardin their 2005 report "Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digitaldata collection.[26]
Data analysis typically involves working with structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such asdata cleaninganddata visualizationto summarize data and develop hypotheses about relationships betweenvariables.Data analyststypically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data.[27]
Data science involves working with larger datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work withunstructured datasuch as text or images and usemachine learningalgorithms to build predictive models. Data science often usesstatistical analysis,data preprocessing, andsupervised learning.[28][29]
Cloud computingcan offer access to large amounts of computational power andstorage.[30]Inbig data, where volumes of information are continually generated and processed, these platforms can be used to handle complex and resource-intensive analytical tasks.[31]
Some distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads. These frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel, which can reduce processing times.[32]
Data science involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data which often includes personal and sensitive information. Ethical concerns include potential privacy violations, bias perpetuation, and negative societal impacts.[33][34]
Machine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.[35][36]
